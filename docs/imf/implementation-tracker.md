## üîß Technical Specifications

### Relationship Web Generator
**Purpose**: Auto-generate NPC connections based on traits, themes, and campaign data

**Core Features**:
- Graph-based relationship mapping
- Compatibility scoring algorithm
- Conflict detection system
- Visual output options (text/graphviz)

**Implementation Plan**:
```ruby
class RelationshipWebGenerator
  def initialize(campaign_context)
    @context = campaign_context
    @relationship_types = load_relationship_types
    @compatibility_rules = load_compatibility_rules
  end
  
  def generate_web(options = {})
    # 1. Load all entities
    # 2. Calculate compatibility scores
    # 3. Generate relationships
    # 4. Detect conflicts/tensions
    # 5. Output in requested format
  end
end
```

### Rumor Mill System
**Purpose**: Generate contextual rumors from campaign events and NPC knowledge

**Core Features**:
- Event-based rumor generation
- Truth distortion levels
- Source attribution
- Rumor evolution over time

**Data Structure**:
```yaml
rumor_templates:
  event_based:
    - "[SOURCE] heard that [EVENT] because [SPECULATION]"
  npc_based:
    - "They say [NPC] has been [SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY]"
  location_based:
    - "Strange [PHENOMENA] near [LOCATION] lately"
```

### Oracle System
**Purpose**: Provide guided random answers for yes/no/maybe questions

**Core Features**:
- Weighted probability system
- Context modifiers
- Complication generation
- Fate dice integration

**Probability Matrix**:
```
Base: Yes(35%) / No(35%) / Maybe(20%) / Complication(10%)
Modifiers:
  - Likely: +20% Yes
  - Unlikely: +20% No
  - Chaotic: +15% Complication
```

### Consequence Engine
**Purpose**: Track actions and generate logical outcomes

**Core Features**:
- Action categorization
- Faction reaction system
- Ripple effect calculation
- Time-delayed consequences

**Action Categories**:
- Violence ‚Üí Fear, Retaliation, Authority Response
- Theft ‚Üí Investigation, Bounty, Reputation Loss
- Heroism ‚Üí Gratitude, Fame, Expectations
- Politics ‚Üí Alliance Shifts, Power Changes

### Event Cascade System
**Purpose**: Generate chain reactions from initial events

**Core Features**:
- Event type classification
- Cascade probability calculation
- Multi-faction impact assessment
- Timeline generation
